```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ai-test-prioritization
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
   Then install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command:
```
python src/main.py
```

## Overview of AI-Powered Test Case Prioritization

Test case prioritization is a technique used in software testing to arrange test cases in a specific order based on certain criteria. This project utilizes AI to analyze historical test data and predict which test cases are most likely to uncover defects. By prioritizing these test cases, teams can ensure that critical tests are executed first, leading to faster feedback and improved software quality.
